A collaborative [master's program](https://eth4d.ethz.ch/Learning/AshesiETH-Master.html) in Mechatronics Engineering between ETH Zurich (Switzerland) and Ashesi University (Ghana) was established in 2019 with the aim of helping Ashesi University, one of the premier undergraduate-only universities in West Africa, develop its first graduate engineering program. Over a course of five years, ETH lecturers teach block-courses onsite in Ghana, where lectures for each course are condensed into two-week blocks. I had the opportunity to lecture for the Digital Electronics block course in 2024 (by myself) and 2025 (co-lecturing with Cindy Karina).

I wrote a short blog post about my experience [here](https://manasakani.github.io/posts/2025/03/ashesi).
