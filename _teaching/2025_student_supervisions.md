At ETH, PhD students can independently propose research projects and recruit masters students to work on them. These come in the form of Bachelor Thesis projects (4 months part-time), Master Semester projects (4 months part-time), and Master Thesis (6 months full-time). These projects are part of undergraduate/graduate curriculum. 

I've supervised 4 semester projects and 3 theses, two of which were awarded the ETH medals.

### Rayen Mahjoub's Master's thesis, September 2024 - March 2025

Investigating the crystalline-amorphous phase changes of Germanium-Antimony-Tellurium (GST) compounds. Set up a pipeline to integrate MD simulations of GST phase change materials with our electronic structure prediction models (trained on DFT data), and used this to explore the variation in electronic wavefunction localization across different levels of crystallinity. Contributed to the creation of a dataset which we used for a paper accepted to [_ICML_](https://openreview.net/forum?id=WGejWCgrpD&referrer=%5Bthe%20profile%20of%20Manasa%20Kaniselvan%5D(%2Fprofile%3Fid%3D~Manasa_Kaniselvan1))

### Alexander Maeder's Master's thesis, September 2023 - March 2024

Developed a distributed iterative Conjugate Gradient solver for a GPU-accelerated Kinetic Monte Carlo code, and equally-contributed to a paper accepted at [_SC'24_](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10793135). [Awarded the ETH Medal](https://nano-tcad.ee.ethz.ch/news/nano-tcad-news/2024/07/two-master-students-from-the-computational-nanoelectronics-group-won-the-eth-medals.html) for his thesis. This work was cosupervised with Alexandros Nikolaos Ziogas (senior researcher). Currently: PhD student in the same group at ETH. 

### Jente Clarysse's Master semester project & thesis, September 2022 - October 2023

Worked with me to extend a driven kinetic Monte Carlo code with current and heat solvers, and used this implementation to investigate unipolar resistive switching mechanisms in NiO. Her work was used for conference papers subsequently accepted at [_DRC'24_](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10605556), [_DRC'25_](add) and a new journal paper [(coming soon)](coming soon). [Awarded the ETH Medal](https://nccr-marvel.ch/news/awards/jente-clarysse-eth-medal-1) for her thesis. Currently: Associate at Boston Consulting Group

### Zhouyang Yu's Master semester project, April 2023 - October 2023

Preformed quantum transport simulations on Interband Cascade Lasers (ICLs). Co-supervised with Mathieu Luisier. Currently: PhD student at National University of Singapore. 

### Patrik Gjini's Bachelor thesis, February 2022 - May 2022

Implemented a Fast Multipole Method algorithm for Poisson's equation. Contributed to a poster which recieved a [commendation](https://www.psik2022.net/poster-award-winners) at the Psi-K conference. Co-supervised with Marko Mladenovic (postdoc). Currently: Master thesis student in the same group.


### Patrick BÃ¼tler's Master semester project, February 2022 - May 2022

Investigated resistive switching in MoTe<sub>2</sub> with _ab-initio_ Molecular Dynamics. Currently: PhD student at IBM Zurich
