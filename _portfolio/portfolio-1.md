The University of Waterloo Nanorobotics Group (UWNRG) designed micro-robotic actuation systems to compete at the annual IEEE International Conference for Robotics and Automation (ICRA) Microbotics Challenges. 

I was a junior member when I started at Waterloo, sub-team lead in my second year, and eventually became the team's Technical Director in my senior year. During my time on the team, I led the developement development of a 300 um microbot we named SAM (Solenoid Actuated Microbot), actuated by external magnetic fields to complete pathfinding tasks and move small triangles around a silicon wafer. I oversaw the funding for lab expenses, equipment, cleanroom usage, and conference travel costs. Our competition Record: 3rd place (ICRA 2015, Seattle USA), 1st place (ICRA 2016, Stockholm Sweden), 2nd place (ICRA 2018, Brisbane Australia).
