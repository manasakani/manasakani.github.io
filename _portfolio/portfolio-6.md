Back in 2015, for my second undergraduate internship, I was a research assistant in the group of Prof. Genki Yoshikawa at NIMS. Along with a fellow Waterloo intern (Max Hamilton, currently PhD student at Waterloo), I worked on integrating a new deposition tool to coat membrane-based nanosensors, and simulating the influence of coffee ring effects.
