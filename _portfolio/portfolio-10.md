I'm doing my PhD at the Computational Nanoelectronics group at ETH Zurich, advised by Prof. Mathieu Luisier. The group operates across several fields, from computational chemistry to high performance computing. I'm lucky to have been able to learn a lot from top researchers in these fields during my time here.
