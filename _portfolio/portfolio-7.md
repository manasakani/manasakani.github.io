In the summer of 2023 I interned with the Device and Process Lab at Samsung Semiconductor, where they develop custom codes for semiconductor device and process simulations, supervised by Dr. Byounghak Lee. I did an implementation within one of these codes to take advantage of symmetries, and presented it to the applications team in South Korea. More generally, I got to see how they iterate between simulations development and applications to support the development of future semiconductor technology.
