In 2017-2018 I worked as a research assistant intern at SLIPS Technologies in Cambridge, MA, supervised by Reena Paink (now a PhD student at Harvard). This involved R&D for product development in polymers/surface science, and involved chemical bench work on a day-to-day basis. I got to interface with the initial investors/customers from the food industry, and see how chemical products are synthesized, scaled up to production, and approved for consumer use.
