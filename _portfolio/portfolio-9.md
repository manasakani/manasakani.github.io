In 2017-2018 I worked as a research assistant intern at SLIPS Technologies in Cambridge, MA, supervised by Reena Paink (now a PhD student at Harvard). This involved R&D for product development in polymers/surface science, and chemical bench work on a day-to-day basis. I also got to interface with the initial investors/customers from the food industry, and it was interesting to see how new chemical products are synthesized, scaled up to production, and approved for use.
