**Abstract:** Filamentary Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM) devices have so far been scaled down to a 2.1 nm feature size, 2 nm thickness, and integrated with advanced transistor nodes for active cell selection. Evaluating their ultimate integration density now involves understanding the scales at which switching can be reliably achieved in matrix-like structures, and the associated failure mechanisms. Previous theoretical studies explored ultrascaled RRAM based on static electronic properties and fixed filament geometry, or continuum/regular domains. While useful, these approaches do not simultaneously capture the underlying structural irregularity of the switching material, and the finite size/number of atoms involved in the switching process, both of which heavily influence the kinetics of atomic relocation and the resulting current flow. Here we leverage a custom atomistic simulation tool designed to capture such effects to investigate the failure mechanisms which emerge in high-density passive RRAM arrays, as well as insight on how they can be mitigated.
