Hi! I'm a PhD Candidate in the [Computational Nanoelectronics group](https://nano-tcad.ee.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zurich, advised by [Prof. Mathieu Luisier](https://ee.ethz.ch/the-department/faculty/professors/person-detail.ODA5MjM=.TGlzdC80MTEsMTA1ODA0MjU5.html). My research interests lie at at the intersection of:

*  ***Ab initio* and atomistic semiconductor device modeling** - developing custom simulation tools to capture the operating physics of emerging semiconductor devices

*  **Geometric deep learning for materials modeling** - adapting symmetry-preserving Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to learn the electronic structure of semiconductor materials at scales otherwise unreachable by Density Functional Theory (DFT)

*  **High performance scientific computing (HPC)** - optimizing custom simulations codes and machine learning models on GPUs and supercomputers to tackle problem scales of experimental relevance

<!-- During my time at ETH so far, I've led projects across these different domains, and the results are published in venues including _ACS Nano_, the _International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage, and Analysis (’SC)_, the _International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML)_, and _Nature Materials_. I've also supervised three Master thesis students (two won the ETH Medals for their theses), and done PhD research internships at the Samsung Semiconductor Device Lab (in San Jose, CA) and Meta AI's FAIR Chemistry team (in San Francisco, CA) in the areas of semiconductor simulation development and AI/ML for electronic struture-property prediction in materials.  -->

During my time at ETH so far, I've led projects across these different domains, with results published in venues such as _ACS Nano_, _’SC (SuperComputing)_, _ICML_, and _Nature Materials_. I've also supervised three Master's thesis students - two of whom were awarded the ETH Medals for their theses - as well as several semester project students who directly contributed to published research. Along with my work at ETH, I've done PhD research internships at the Samsung Semiconductor Device Lab (in San Jose, CA) and Meta AI's FAIR Chemistry team (in San Francisco, CA, ongoing) in the areas of semiconductor simulation development and AI/ML for _ab initio_ struture-property prediction in materials. My early research was partially funded by the _NSERC PGSD_ PhD Fellowship which Canadian students can hold internationally. 

Going forward, I'm excited about driving methods- and application-based research in HPC/ML to unite state-of-the-art quantum mechanical materials simulations with advanced device transport approaches. This can enable predictive, atomically-resolved simulations of devices large enough to be fabricated and measured in the lab. It would also unlock computational investigations of effects like structural or compositional disorder, atomic motion, and other complex phenomena which can only be captured at scale.  

I'm also excited about collaborating with researchers and industry labs from different fields, having technical discussions about project ideas, and generally thinking about what we can accomplish and the impact we can have with enough combined expertise. So if you have questions or ideas for cool projects together, **let's discuss**!

[Note: I just started this website, and it's a work in progress!]

<!-- Over the past few years, I've pursed some general topics that united these areas. More often than not, it takes far more time to develop the methods and code than to explore the intended applications. However, since I started out as a researcher in the field of semiconductor device physics, I still like to think of my overarching projects in terms of the kinds of devices I wanted to model:

**Phase Change Memory (PCM)** - PCM cells exhibit gradual structural phase transitions which translates into a tunable resistance effect. The chemical composition space of these materials is large, but their specific composition and stoichiometry directly determine acheivable resistance contrast and stability. This makes a computational investigation of this space an attractive prospect. Simulating this involves being able to recompute the electronic structure during structural phase changes, which is computationally unfeasible with conventional methods. This is what I hope to do through the use of equivariant Graph Neural Networks [arxiv] combined with full-batch distributed training to handle the large graphs encountered [submitted_SC25].

**Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM) Arrays** - RRAM is an emerging high-density non-volatile memory technology which operates on the principle of reversible dielectric breakdown. After first investigating current flow through these devices on an *ab intitio* level of theory which combined DFT and Quantum Transport [ACSNano2023], I developed a kinetic Monte Carlo application to capture the relevant physics at much larger scales [SC24], and explored potential failure mechanism at the atomistic scale which occur when devices are integrated into memory arrays [DRC2025]. Recently, I've been working with experimental collaborators at IBM Zurich to investigate the detailed mechanisms behind the soft dielectric breakdown effect, and how we can reduce the voltages required to acheive it [submitted_ACSNano2025]

**Strain-engineered 2D-material transistors** - I started out in the field of semiconductor device physics by using DFT and Quantum Transport methods to investigate the influence of lattice strain to improve the drive currents [APL] and reduce tunneling leakage [EDL] in 2D-material transistors. -->
